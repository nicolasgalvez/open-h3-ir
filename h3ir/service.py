    that does not know the word gets a perfectly valid brief back with the swap bound to whoever the

    that names the key, which a newer client can read and act on. `h3ir.contract.ASSET_FIELDS` is
    the same list, published so a client can check before it spends the request.

    `path` is the fast way and needs one filesystem: nothing is copied, and the bytes H3 is
    conditioned on are the bytes the caller already had. `sha256` is the way in for a caller on
    another machine, naming an attachment it has already sent to `PUT /v1/assets/{sha256}`.
