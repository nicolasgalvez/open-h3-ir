"""What crosses the boundary between the compiler and anything that drives it, published.

The compiler and the ComfyUI node pack ship to two different audiences and are becoming two
repositories. A handful of facts have to be true in both of them at once, and until now the only
thing holding each one true was a test that opened the other half's source file and read it as text.
Those tests cannot exist once the halves live apart, and two of them were already guarding the wrong
hop -- see `tests/test_contract.py` for the one that passed while the field it guarded was being
dropped in transit.

So the compiler states the contract instead of a test inferring it. One module, built from the
authorities rather than restating them, published three ways:

    import          `from h3ir.contract import contract` -- for a caller in the same Python
    HTTP            `GET /v1/contract` -- for a caller on another machine
    command         `h3ir contract` -- for a human, and for whoever regenerates a copy

**Nothing here is a second source of truth.** Every section is read off the thing that already owns
it: `Role` for the roles, `director.DIRECTORS` for the profiles, `grid` for the ceilings, `shots`
for the shot cap. The one exception is the wire field names, and it is deliberate: those live on
pydantic models in `service.py`, this module may not import fastapi, and
`test_contract_matches_the_wire_models` pins the two together from the compiler's own side where
both are present. A literal with a test on it is honest; a literal without one is the drift this
module exists to end.

**`CONTRACT_VERSION` is its own number and it is not the package version.** A package version moves
for reasons that touch nothing a client can see. This moves only when one of the sections below
changes, and `tests/test_contract.py` holds the digest of every section against it, so changing a
director's prose without saying the contract changed is a red test rather than a discovery someone
makes later.

**What a client does about a difference is the client's business, not this module's.** Nothing here
refuses anything. It publishes facts and the digests that make comparing them cheap; the node pack
decides which differences stop a queue and which are worth a line in a report, because only the
caller knows what its own graph is about to send. See `contract.py` in the node pack.

# WHICH SURFACE THESE DESCRIBE, because getting it wrong builds the wrong thing.
#
# `ASSET_FIELDS`, `BRIEF_FIELDS` and `DIALOGUE_FIELDS` are the keys of a REQUEST -- the JSON a
# caller posts to `POST /v1/briefs`. They are not the fields of `models.Brief` and `models.AssetRef`,
# which are the compiler's own dataclasses and carry a different set: `role_stated`, `px`,
# `composition`, `canvas` and more, none of which a caller may state.
#
# That distinction matters now that a client can run the compiler in the same Python. Measured:
# every compiler module imports with fastapi and pydantic absent EXCEPT `service.py`, which is
# where `_to_brief` -- the only conversion from a request into a `Brief` -- lives, along with the
# refusals it raises. So an in-process caller either drags fastapi into its host to reuse that
# conversion, or builds the dataclasses itself and takes on `role_stated` and the pairing rules.
# A caller that builds dataclasses gets its field names checked by Python at call time, which is
# loud and needs no contract; what it does NOT get checked is everything below this block, and
# that is where the contract earns its place on both paths.

#
# Written out rather than read off the model because this module has to import with fastapi and
# pydantic absent -- the node pack calls the compiler in-process and ComfyUI's Python is not the
# compiler's. `test_contract_matches_the_wire_models` holds the two together from the compiler's own
# side, where both are installed.
#
# This is the list whose drift is the quietest failure in the whole system: pydantic used to drop an
# unknown key in silence, so a picture arrived saying nothing about who it replaces, and that
# compiles, validates and renders the wrong swap. `AssetIn` forbids extras now and names the key it
# did not know, and this list is how a client can tell before it spends the request.

# Every refusal a client can be handed: the status it arrives on, and which call can produce it. A
# client branches on these to say something useful instead of printing a status code, so a code
# raised over here with no branch over there is a caller that shrugs at a failure it could have
# explained.
#
# `on` matters as much as `status`. The node pack talks to two routes and their messages are not
# interchangeable: a failed brief is explained in terms of the graph, and a failed upload has to
# name the tray slot the file came from, because to the service an uploaded file IS its content
# hash and a message naming a hash tells somebody with nine references nothing. One code is raised
# on both, so this is a list rather than a single name.
#
# Declared rather than scanned, for the reason the field lists above are: a scan of source text is
# not something a client on another machine can run. `test_contract.py` holds it against the source
# from the compiler's own side, where the source is.
#
# Twelve of these are raised by `compile.py` as a `BriefRefused` and re-raised by the brief route,
# so a scan of `service.py` alone cannot see any of them. Only `over-capacity` was ever noticed,
# because it is the one raised through a subclass and the scan looking for them looked for
# `super().__init__`. The other eleven -- every refusal about a contradictory request, including all
# four about who a picture replaces -- were invisible to the check that was meant to prove every
# refusal reaches a client with a sentence attached.
